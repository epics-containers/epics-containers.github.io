# Contributing to the project

Contributions and issues are most welcome! All issues and pull requests are
handled through [GitHub]. Also, please check for any existing issues before
filing a new one. If you have a great idea but it involves big changes, please
file a ticket before making a pull request! We want to make sure you don't spend
your time coding something that might not fit the scope of the project.

## Issue or Discussion?

Github also offers [discussions] as a place to ask questions and share ideas. If
your issue is open ended and it is not obvious when it can be "closed", please
raise it as a discussion instead.

## Developer guide

The [Developer Guide] contains information on setting up a development
environment, building docs and what standards the documentation
should follow.
