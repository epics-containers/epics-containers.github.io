# epics-containers

Documentation for the epics-containers framework

This is where you should write a short paragraph that describes what your module does,
how it does it, and why people should use it.

Source          | <https://github.com/epics-containers/epic-containers.github.io>
:---:           | :---:
PyPI            | `pip install epic-containers`
Documentation   | <https://epics-containers.github.io/epic-containers.github.io>
Releases        | <https://github.com/epics-containers/epic-containers.github.io/releases>

This is where you should put some images or code snippets that illustrate
some relevant examples. If it is a library then you might put some
introductory code here:

```python
from epics-containers import __version__

print(f"Hello epics-containers {__version__}")
```

Or if it is a commandline tool then you might put some example commands here:

```
python -m epics-containers --version
```
