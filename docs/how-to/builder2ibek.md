TODO: this page is WIP and will be updated soon.

`builder2ibek` is a tool to convert DLS builder XML to ibek instance YAML.
It is for working with converting IOC instances to epics-containers.

At present (until a new python app distribution mechanism is in place) it
is installed at DLS in the following location:

`/dls_sw/work/python3/ec-venv/bin/builder2ibek`
