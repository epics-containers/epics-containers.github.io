# Add an IOC to the Kubernetes Beamline

In this tutorial we will add an additional IOC to the Kubernetes Simulation Beamline created in the previous tutorial.

This IOC will be a Simulation Area Detector IOC, very like the one we made in {any}`create_ioc`.

Here we will also take a look at the helm chart and resulting Kubernetes Manifest that is created as part of this process.
