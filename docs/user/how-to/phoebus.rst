Viewing Operator Interfaces with Phoebus
========================================

Phoebus is a Java application that can be used to view operator interfaces.

epics-containers will support auto generation of engineering screens for
Phoebus using `PVI <https://github.com/epics-containers/pvi>`_.
This is the initial target for epics-containers GUIs, other OPI
formats may be supported in the future.

OPI file generation is work in progress and this page will be updated when
it is ready (est Nov 2023).
