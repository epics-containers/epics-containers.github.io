Working with your own code editor
=================================

If you have your own preferred code editor, you can use it instead of
vscode. This does mean that you will forgo the benefits of the devcontainer
integration.

TODO: update dev-e7 to have its own launcher like
https://github.com/dls-controls/dev-c7
then link to it's documentation and discuss how to use it with epics-containers.

If you do not want to use a devcontainer at all and instead prefer to install all
the tools natively on your workstation then please see `native_tools`
