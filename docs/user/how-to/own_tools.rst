Choose Your Developer Environment
=================================

The tutorials walk through the use of a standard set of developer tools. You
can use others if you wish but support is limited currently.

.. _own_editor:

Working with your own code editor
---------------------------------

If you have your own preferred code editor, you can use it instead of
vscode. We recommend developing generic IOCs using
a devcontainer. Devcontainer supporting tools are listed here
https://containers.dev/supporting.

epics-containers has been tested with

- vscode
- Github Codespaces


TODO: add instructions for using other editors. Potentially we could enhance
the epics-containers-cli to support other editors with minimal effort.
