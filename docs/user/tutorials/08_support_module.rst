Working with Support Modules
=============================

Here we will see how to create a new support module for new hardware. This
will include creating a new generic IOC to make use of this support.

We will also see how to locally test changes to a support module.

TODO: suggest that we will make a new Stream Device that will be a
simple echo server.
