Changing the Generic IOC
========================

This tutorial will make a simple change to the Generic IOC ``ioc-adsimdetector``.
We will also update the IOC instance ``bl01t-ea-ioc-02`` use the new feature of
the Generic IOC.
This is a type 2 change from `ioc_change_types`.

We are going to add an additional support module to the Generic IOC and then
use it to add a new record to the IOC instance to use this new support.

For this exercise all changes will be local so you will not need to make a
fork of ``ioc-adsimdetector``. The next tutorial will show how to a new
Generic IOC and we will look at the Generic IOC CI at that time.

TODO: WIP.
