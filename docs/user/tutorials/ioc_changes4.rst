Making a new Support Module
===========================

This tutorial will create a new Generic IOC for a new support module. We will
then create a new IOC Instance that uses this new support module.
This is a type 3 change from `ioc_change_types`.

This exercise will create a new Stream Device support module that implements
a very simple ASCII protocol. So simple that we will be able to test it
by typing into a telnet session.

TODO: WIP.
