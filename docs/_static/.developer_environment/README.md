Empty Devcontainer Local Feature
================================

These files define an empty devcontainer local feature which does nothing.

This is used to supply a placeholder for epics-containers projects
that want to dynamically add user customization features to their devcontainers.

Because the inclusion of a feature is not configurable we need and empty
placeholder for those users that do no supply their own custom feature.
