# Viewing Operator Interfaces with Phoebus

Phoebus is a Java application that can be used to view operator interfaces.

epics-containers supports auto generation of engineering screens for Phoebus using [PVI](https://github.com/epics-containers/pvi). This is the initial target for epics-containers GUIs, other OPI formats may be supported in the future.

Auto-generation of engineering screens is now supported in generic IOCs.

See here for an example [example-services](https://github.com/epics-containers/example-services).
